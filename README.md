Original Repo found here: http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/


# Disclaimer
**I am not taking credit for creating this from the ground up.**
I just liked the concept so I changed some backend logic, added a scoreboard, and changed styling. 

# How to start
1. Clone this repo
1. cd into the folder
1. run `npm install`

**If you want the scoreboard to work, please download it [here](http://github.com/pedersendane/github-pages-2048-server) and follow the instructions**
