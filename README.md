# 2048 Clone

Original Repo found here: http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

Working demo found here: https://pedersendane.github.io/github-pages-2048-clone/

# Disclaimer
**I am not taking credit for creating this from the ground up.**
I just liked the concept so I changed some backend logic, added a scoreboard, and changed styling. 

# How to start
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into the folder
3. Run `npm install`
  3. (Optional) Start the scoreboard server with `npm run start`. If you have not cloned the server, it can be found below. The app will run without the scoreboard.
5. Run `npm run start`

**If you want the scoreboard to work, please download it [here](http://github.com/pedersendane/github-pages-2048-server) and follow the instructions**
